## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles by applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and TF-IDF vectorization. The goal is to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles categorized as either "real" or "fake." You can find a suitable dataset on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or other open data sources.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - Matplotlib

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:
```bash
python fake_news_detection.py
```

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves:
- Removing stopwords and punctuation
- Eliminating irrelevant characters
- Converting all text to lowercase

This step ensures that the model focuses on the essential features of the text.

## Model Training
The cleaned text is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF vectorization. Various classification algorithms are tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to determine the most effective model for fake news detection.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

These metrics help assess the reliability of the model in distinguishing between real and fake news.

## Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced NLP techniques, such as word embeddings (Word2Vec or GloVe).
- Implement a deep learning model for improved accuracy.
- Integrate user input functionality to classify new articles dynamically.
